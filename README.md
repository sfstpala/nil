## Functional programming language

Nil (which stands for `'(not in lisp)`) is a small, functional language with
a bytecode compiler and virtual machine. It's very much a work in progress,
with no fixed specification for even the semantics.

### Types

Types are integers (bignums), floats (double precision), lists and functions.
The literals for the first three are what you'd expect.

### Forms

 - Atom

    12.5
    "hello"
    ...

 - Function call

    (function argument)
    (function argument argument)
    ...

 - Definition

    (define name value)

 - Function

    (lambda (x) (* x x))
    (lambda (x y) (* y x))
    (lambda xs (car xs))

 - Conditional

    (if condition true-case false-case)

To define a function f(x) = xÂ², you'd say

    (define f (lambda (x)
        (^ x 2)))

This is a function that calculates the product of a list of numbers:

    (define product (lambda (m)
        (if m
                (* (car m) (product (cdr m)))
            1)))
